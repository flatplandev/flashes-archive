<p>A US report said this month that older workers were increasingly turning to the “gig economy” to give them the earnings and flexibility that is assumed to be the exclusive concern of young people. The research was carried out by the AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), a non-profit membership body which this year celebrates its 65th anniversary. It was created by a retired teacher campaigning to persuade insurers that health insurance for 50+ people (like her) could be profitable. </p>



<p>Retired people are often portrayed as inactive. But, increasingly, they’re the most powerful and influential consumers.</p>



<p>People around the world are living longer, healthier lives taking the opportunity to travel and spend their pensions and savings. In the US, the AARP helps its 38m members to re-imagine their lives with advice, inspiration and help. It begins when Americans reach their 50th birthday and, presumably, are often jolted to receive their first issue of the iconic AARP magazine.</p>



<p>The AARP is a formidable advocate for social change on behalf of its members. It campaigns against age discrimination in the jobs market, for family care-giver support, affordable healthcare and housing communities for seniors. Its 10 ‘most viewed member benefits include: low-cost insurance, car buying, travel, jobs and games. It also produces a range of digital and print media including, incidentally, what has long been the most-read magazine in the US. A decade ago, it launched Life Reimagined, a “first-of-its-kind series of online and off-line experiences that guide people through life transitions by helping them discover new possibilities and connect with a community of people pursuing similar passions and goals”.</p>



<p>Some of its services are more surprising, like the AARP Innovation Lab which funds some of the best and brightest 50+ startups.</p>



<p>Year after year, it reports impressive engagement stats that, in 2021, included: $745m in tax refunds for members, 2m attendees at virtual meetings, 600k visitors to the “virtual community center”, $3.2m grants to the needy, and more than $600k funding for 25 startups. </p>



<p>But, most surprising of all, this energetic membership organisation is also one of America’s largest media groups:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>AARP  Inc   $</strong></td><td><strong>2021</strong></td><td><strong>2020</strong></td><td><br><strong>2019</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>   <strong>Advertising</strong></td><td>  149m</td><td>  137m</td><td> 141m</td></tr><tr><td>   <strong>eCommerce</strong></td><td>1.1bn</td><td>1.0bn</td><td>0.9bn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total media revenue</strong></td><td>1.25bn</td><td>1.14bn</td><td>1.0bn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total AARP revenue</strong></td><td>1.8bn</td><td>1.8bn</td><td>1.6bn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Media % of AARP</strong> <strong>revenue</strong></td><td>69%</td><td>56%</td><td>63%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Source: AARP</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>AARP has has been able to fund its substantial expansion in services and support for its members through media development – not annual membership fees which have affordably stayed at $12-16 for many years. Helped, presumably, by its $4bn of investments, grants and legacies.</p>



<p>As the table (above) shows, the association has sailed through the pandemic much better than most media companies. Its $1bn+ of eCommerce (roughly 80% healthcare, 20% financial) – perhaps at least double that achieved by digital high-fliers like Future, Dotdash Meredith and Hearst.</p>



<p>The AARP magazine has a circulation of 22.5m and publishes six times annually, with 37m total readership per issue. It has three demographic editions –  for people in their 50s,  60s, and 70+. AARP Bulletin, with a 10-times annual frequency, spotlights news and policy-driven content for  50+Americans</p>



<p>But – across the media – so much advertising targets young people, at least partly because of the overall value of lifetime loyalty: young people have longer to live and to spend. </p>



<p>The reality in many countries, however, is that the 50+ comprise some one-third of the population, almost two-thirds of them 65+.</p>



<p>They often have more money (sometimes a lot more) and changing lifestyles, arguably, make them more interested in fashions, travel and socialising than ever before. In the US, the demographic is variously estimated to account for more than 50% of all consumer spending and of annual household income. They have an average household net worth that’s 66% higher than 18-49 year olds.</p>



<p>It’s a similar story in the UK where even state pensions this year are being increased by 10% – about double the pay rise of most working people. But that’s only part of the story because the government that is protecting retirement incomes says the average spending of recent retirees with higher-than-average incomes&nbsp;increases&nbsp;through their 60s and 70s. It all leads to increased spending on holidays, and declines only once people are into their 80s. At that point, they become big savers ie customers for banks and financial services.</p>



<p>That’s why companies are starting to target this older demographic more consistently.</p>



<p>It’s not surprising that a print magazine is still treasured by AARP members. But it’s a great digital product too, offering compelling content on money, health, work, travel and puzzles. </p>



<p>AARP is the most successful magazine-led generator of eCommerce and its unrivalled reader-subscriber-member loyalty comes from a realisation that “membership” is so much more than the mere magazine subscription that some publishers believe. The simple conclusion to draw is that membership can turbocharge eCommerce.</p>



<p>Take the recent deal under which it promotes the Oak Street Health chain of primary care outlets. Oak Street has exclusive rights to use the trusted AARP brand in emails, website and the magazine – for which AARP gets an undisclosed fee. It’s a nice mix of the various ways in which magazines have devised to get marketing income: eCommerce and product endorsement (eg the Good Housekeeping Institute in the US and UK) and product licensing like Better Homes &amp; Garden’s huge revenue stream, especially through branded homecare products in Walmart. Like a whole range of other products and services, the Oak Street deal is promoted as a member benefit. It’s one of host of high-yielding deals that have powered AARP revenue. </p>



<p>Critics have sometimes sniped at the blatant commercialism that allegedly blurs recommendations and sponsored messages but it’s a brilliant business which knows how to make money. Membership deals and money saving ideas are powerful earners for the AARP and its members alike. Being a non-profit must help, of course. But even businesses can do it.</p>



<p>Transatlantic Brits must wonder why the success has never been emulated by the UK-owned Saga which was launched in 1951, seven years before the AARP.  </p>



<p>For 72 years, Saga has targeted 50+ Brits, principally with holidays and insurance. But the family-owned company was sold to private equity for £1.4bn in 2006 and IPOd for £2.1bn in 2014. Since then, it has spluttered through some disastrous acquisitions, including nursing homes. And then came covid. The company entered the pandemic in poor shape with heavy borrowings – just as its travel business collapsed and insurance claims rocketed. </p>



<p>In 2020, the former owner Roger de Haan – whose father had built the business – returned to rescue Saga by buying a 20% stake for £100m some 36 years after he had sold-out to private equity. With borrowings of £700m and indications that it is selling off its insurance broking, the Saga Plc enterprise value – at £900m – is not much more than half that in 2019. Its market cap is a mere 20% of what it was four years ago.</p>



<p>The turmoil years of falling sales had taken their toll on a company which really should have developed much more like AARP.  Saga’s own flagship magazine was also once the country’s biggest circulation monthly with sales of some 1.2bn. But  it is now languishing with less than 200k. A once promising radio station has long since vanished.</p>



<p>This week, Saga disclosed its breakthrough into profit for the first six months of the year and, in addition to the planned divestment, seems to be signalling a return to the kind of media-oriented activity long enjoyed by AARP. It has launched Saga Exceptional, a  website “specifically for older consumers, providing a place for them to find best-in-class advice along with inspirational stories, written by people who understand their passions and their needs… a place for the over 50s to be seen and heard, while enabling Saga to interact with its customer base on a daily basis”. </p>



<p>Saga aims to drive revenue through advertising, sponsorship, endorsements and affiliate deals. The wider media strategy would include newsletters, “greater leverage of Saga Magazine content” and an expanded social media presence. It will – claims the company – turn Saga into a “superbrand for older people” and adapt the magazine for the digital age. </p>



<p>It is all too ironic that this is what many UK consumers believed Saga had once been – in the 20th century. </p>



<p>This week’s announcements may just signal a fight-back by the UK company that once pioneered media targeted at older demographics. But there’s a long way to go, which is why mainstream publishers with readership in these age groups should themselves learn the lessons of the AARP. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Build a strong cohesive community through a wide range of digital and print information, entertainment and education </li>



<li>Establish low-cost membership. It’s all about creating a sense of audience ‘belonging’ which comes from the provision of practical information and inspiration – and from 360-degree support for members. If publishers want to depend on membership, members need to be able to depend on them</li>



<li>Campaign publicly for the rights and interests of members. </li>



<li>Maximise the commercial revenue from eCommerce, advertising, licensing and sponsorship.</li>
</ul>



<p>UK-based media groups with strong 50+ brands like Future (Woman &amp; Home magazine), Hearst (Good Housekeeping), Immediate (Radio Times), the Telegraph Media Group and even Boom Radio might just rush to fill the country’s “AARP gap” – before the waking Saga manages to make up for lost time. </p>



<p>AARP”s “wrap around” membership should be inspiration too for publishers in other markets. It may be the perfect model.</p>
