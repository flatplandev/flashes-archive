<p><em>Eric Yang is CEO, founder and majority owner of the US-based Gear Patrol, “a daily magazine for men…dedicated to informing today’s generation of consumers about the best products with which to pursue their lives”. It began life in 2007 as a personal blog about products he was interested in, posted in the evenings and weekends while he was an art director at CBS after having previously been a producer for Scripps Interactive. </em></p>



<p><em>He had felt that the existing sites targeted at him were “focused on bro culture in men”, in the days when gadget media shared many of the sexual images that had made men’s magazines like FHM and Maxim so successful in the last decade of the 20th century. After almost three years with his side hustle, Yang left CBS with his savings and rented space at WeWork in New York where he was joined by Ben Bowers who would become a co-founder of Gear Patrol, first as a website and later also as a glossy magazine. The mission was to tell their audience: What’s new? What’s to discover? How to utilise my stuff better? </em></p>



<p><em>The now twice-yearly, 160-page magazine has helped to define Gear Patrol with its deep-dive features, original photography and sharp design. Yang is emphatic that his business is all about “product journalism not commerce content”. Amid the apparent commoditisation of eCommerce, he is determined to build understanding of his audience and its “intent”. Last month, it had 7.6m site visits, mostly from search or direct and – deliberately – few from social media. The 50-person company generates an estimated $20-30m of revenue and  “a healthy and growing EBITDA”, 70% from ads and 30% from eCommerce. </em></p>



<p><em>For the past four years, Hearst Magazines has been a minority investor, initiated in 2018 by former president Troy Young. But</em> it<em> recently sold its shares back to Gear Patrol. That’s why Yang – whose company has been profitable for all but one of its 15 years – sees 2023 almost as a new beginning, wholly independent again.</em></p>



<p><em>Yang is an economics graduate from the University of Tennessee, in Knoxville.</em></p>

<p><strong>What were your earliest career ambitions?</strong></p>



<p>I grew up deeply obsessed with reading magazines and newspapers and originally wanted to be a magazine editor or a film director, but I didn’t have the pedigree or the socio-economics to pursue that in earnest. And, because our family lived through periods of food and money insecurity, I learned to work on our small business at a very early age. It taught me about grit, taking care of employees, and business instincts. </p>



<p>Somewhere along the way, my love of content and business started converging so it feels natural to be here. While I personally don’t create as much as I would like to anymore, my ambitions have evolved into creating an environment where people – my team – can prosper by advancing their own careers. It’s very rewarding. So, with Gear Patrol, I’m actually living out my earliest ambitions. I go to work feeling like I have found my ikigai.</p>



<p><strong>What was your first job in media?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It was as a television advertising traffic coordinator at Scripps Networks in Knoxville, Tennessee. I called and wrote to everyone at Scripps in the department for that job until someone decided to give me a shot at it. It was entry level, and I worked really hard, but I was terrible at it. But being terrible at that first job actually made me more hungry to succeed so I asked to be given anything people didn’t want to do like data entry or handling calls. I was relentless and worked around the clock. I tried to meet people from other departments to see what they did and to learn from them. This eventually led me into a chance to work on the digital side of the business where things really started to click for me. I just loved observing everything from inter-office politics, team dynamics, and seeing what really frustrated or motivated people. Taking on all those unwanted, thankless projects gave me a chance to get exposure to the process and learn from people where I was able to gain a real sense of confidence.</p>



<p><strong>What were your milestones at Scripps and CBS?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At Scripps, I eventually earned a spot to work with the team that launched an early video magazine called Living.com. Being involved at the hands-on level to see how someone like Scripps could leverage a relationship with Microsoft and bring on sponsors like GMC, to build something that eventually won an Emmy award (yes), put an indelible mark on me. I got to see first-hand the positive impact from bringing people together around a wildly ambitious idea to push the state of the art forward and create lasting change. </p>



<p>As for CBS, I was recruited to work on a “startup” within the company whose charter was to build and platform all of CBS’s owned and operated local television websites onto a singular managed service. I got to touch and contribute to so many parts of that business including helping establish a digital newsroom, serve a national sales operation, design components of a content management system and help craft narratives for corporate collateral. It was exciting, challenging and messy, and I loved it. I learned a lot in the decade I worked on these things and I’m grateful to the people who backed me along the way.</p>



<p><strong>When did you get the idea for Gear Patrol?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Back in 2007, I was skiing in Colorado when my binding failed, which led to a bad accident that tore up my knee so Ski Patrol had to bring me down off the mountain. It’s not very glamorous, because the accident was really caused, in equal parts by an overestimation in my abilities and a failure in my gear. But, while I was recovering, I became rather obsessed with what happened with my binding, which led me to buy a $10 URL on Yahoo so I could set up a blog: Gear Patrol. I was pretty familiar with blogs because I had already been writing through college on a personal one called the Midweekpost. These were the earliest days of commercially-viable blogs but Gear Patrol was just something I spent a lot of time showing my friends and family. It’s pretty cool to see where it’s come. We didn’t take outside capital until Hearst in 2018. In the early days, I just funded it with everything I had left-over from my day job and, whenever things were tight, I sold everything I owned and yanked the rest out of my savings and retirement plan, which was just a terrible financial decision at the time.</p>



<p><strong>What do you remember most about the early days?</strong></p>



<p>The most memorable moment was seeing the first visitor show up in Google Analytics on April 1st when the site went live. I cheated, though, because that first visitor was my dad. I asked him to visit the site. It may sound odd, but sometimes I look back to the very beginning of our Google Analytics to see his session. When you’re bootstrapping, you’re constantly in some kind of state of scared. The key thing is to process that into healthy energy, which I learned to do early in life. It’s an extraordinarily clarifying thing when “Option B” is failure, especially when people’s lives depend on you not screwing up. There aren’t other options. But, going back to my dad for a moment, I watched him bet the farm a few times to keep our family fed and I learned to actually galvanize and think sharper when times are tough. </p>



<p>I’m not sure I’ve quite had that moment where I felt like I knew we’d be successful. I thought it might have happened when we crossed 1mn visitors or 5mn visitors, or maybe $1mn in revenue or $10mn, or even winning awards. But those still just feel like mile markers on the way to building something more important. If I were to peg a feeling of success to anything, I would probably say it was when someone tells me “oh yeah, I love Gear Patrol, I read it every week!” Hearing that makes me feel like we’re working towards something that might actually put a little dent in our corner of the universe.</p>



<p><strong>What’s special about Gear Patrol?</strong></p>



<p>I believe what makes us who we are is that we work very hard to make the process of figuring out what’s next a little more special. Buying and learning on the web has become such a transactional process. I get that people are busy but there’s less and less wonder or the magical feeling you get when you discover something at a store or feel inspired to learn about something new and pursue it. It’s the difference between buying versus shopping or Googling something versus being inspired. Commerce content has become highly commoditized, but it takes so much more to be good at discovery where you learn from an authentic or authoritative perspective where people go from curious to intentional. We’re working very hard to be good at the art and science of driving intent.</p>



<p>I’m very proud that we were some of the earliest pioneers on the web, helping people figure out what to buy, and that we figured out how to find the poetry in doing that. We run a business, of course, and do our best to cultivate a culture of excellence. But our mission is centered around Product Journalism, which is a phrase we coined a long time ago, and our brand is rooted in our ability to do that tastefully. I’m really proud of the fact that we’ve assembled such an enormously talented team of individuals who truly aspire to achieve that mission in our daily report and live up to our brand values.</p>



<p><strong>What have been the best achievements so far?</strong></p>



<p>Three things. The first is surviving the pandemic with our integrity, core values, and our newsroom intact. And then it’s coming out of the pandemic wiser, financially stronger and more optimistic about our future than we’ve ever been. Steering through that period left a few permanent wrinkles on my brain.</p>



<p>The second would be the conscious decision to actually do the hard work to establish and grow a real, actual culture, which dates to before the pandemic. I believe we can build the best place to work in media and we’re making meaningful progress to get there. It sounds a bit pious for me to say that with my CEO hat on, so you’ll just have to fact-check that with our team! We’re imperfect, but we work hard to manage our team in the same way a smart performance-oriented organization should: respectfully. Establishing this culture has truly made positive changes in our company’s physiology and that feels like an ongoing achievement. </p>



<p>The third may sound a bit ironic because my blood runs digital and I breathe technology but I’m very proud of what we’ve accomplished with our print magazine. It’s the highest form of content outside of digital and leaves a consecutive and permanent artifact of our mission. I believe our team understands that intuitively, even if it’s not said. And it’s also profitable. We’re about to publish our 20th issue, which will have more distribution than ever before. The progress we’ve made in five years since I originally put the project into motion feels even more meaningful because it’s become something entirely driven by the team. I never tire of looking through the magazines and seeing the work. It’s become my/our business card.</p>



<p><strong>What is your own primary role?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Over the past couple of years, my role has been primarily focused on survival and cohesion. But, with the more challenging days hopefully behind us, economy willing, my job has evolved into renewal and reinvigoration. We are highly attentive to the challenging economic conditions we’re facing at this moment in 2023, but I can’t help but be thrilled about what’s ahead. So, right now, most of my time is prioritized around the key things I need to do to help Gear Patrol maintain its momentum through this turbulence so we can pursue a new chapter of growth for the company in full force.</p>



<p>On one hand, I’m pretty proud of my track record of juggling the perpetual commercial arbitrage, growth pressure, and cultural balance that a media operation has to manage. On the other hand, though, I think I have a skill for spotting future opportunities for our brand and making sure we consider and pursue those things through our values and not get distracted by naysayers. Basically, I’m the person you hire to figure out how to blow a hole through a mountain to get a train to the other side, not necessarily the one you hire to get the trains to run on time.</p>



<p>I like creating in any medium, but I love inventing the things that help others invent. And I love the pressure to do things people aren’t comfortable with, things that affect the future, or things that exist outside of normal operating parameters. When it’s all on the table, I find myself able to tap into a source of endless energy.</p>



<p><strong>How was the relationship with Hearst?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I can’t share too much on the specifics, but we always operated independently from Hearst which, like any smart investor,  had an expectation for us to stand up on our own. Beyond that, we’ve worked together in a technology capacity and governance perspective. I have a real admiration for Hearst. Their legacy, their impact on the media landscape, and the company’s foresight to look beyond that. I grew up on some of their magazines. And as a student of media, it’s been fascinating.</p>



<p>The relationship with Hearst Magazines happened because I had a long relationship with some of the then leadership team. We had long talked about what Gear Patrol could do with more resources and, for our part, we were drawn to their monolithic business confidence, technology – and their talent. We believed we had much to learn from that while providing their team with our own learnings in Product Journalism.</p>



<p>The timing of this interview is interesting because  we are now once again pursuing a fresh path on our own as an independent media company. I am deeply thankful for the partnership with Hearst over the past few years – and now to be at a place where we can apply the cumulative knowledge and progress we’ve made towards a fresh new vision for the company. We think we’re just getting started.</p>



<p><strong>What’s your vision for Gear Patrol?</strong></p>



<p>To build a media powerhouse for discerning enthusiasts of all shapes and colors.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the best lesson you have learned?</strong></p>



<p>Incremental progress is critical but incrementalism can be pernicious. Know when to stay focused or risk a breakthrough change.</p>



<p><strong>What companies do you most admire?</strong></p>



<p>● Disney for their mastery of media, entertainment and technology.</p>



<p>● Apple for their unrelenting iteration and commitment to accessibility.</p>



<p>● Rolex for their resolve.</p>



<p>● Costco for their commitment to, and understanding of, its members.</p>



<p>● Porsche for their engineering and dependability and yet somehow also being an object of desire.</p>



<p>● Delta for their ability to operate such a hard business and still achieve high employee and customer satisfaction.</p>
