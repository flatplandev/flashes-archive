<p>The privately-owned Penske Media Group (PMC), of the US, has become the largest shareholder in Vox Media, publisher of Vox, New York magazine, Popsugar, Thrillist, The Verge,Vulture and SB Nation. It is said that the two companies will continue to operate independently. PMC CEO and founder Jay Penske will join the Vox board. </p>



<p>It is believed that the 19-year-old PMC – publisher of Variety, Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone – is paying $100mn for a 20% stake in&nbsp;Vox whose previous investors have included NBC Universal and which, in 2021, had merged with Group Nine Media, backed by Discovery. That was two years after Vox had acquired New York magazine. </p>



<p>In a sign of how things have changed for digital media, Vox was valued at $1bn (about double that in the PMC deal) when NBCUniversal invested $200m back in 2015.</p>



<p>PMC itself has grown rapidly in recent years, has an estimated $1bn+ revenue, a monthly audience of 310m worldwide and employs more than 1,500 people in 14 countries. It is believed to have spent more than $400mn on some 20 acquisitions in the last decade.</p>



<p>Founder Jay Penske is the son of celebrated former US racing driver Roger Penske who is also founder and chairman of the $8bn Penske Automotive Group Inc. </p>



<p>In 2003, Jay Penske founded Mail. com, an email portal which he sold to United Internet, of Germany, for almost €100 seven years later. He co-founded Firefly, creator of mobile phones for children (complete with “Call Mom” and “Call Dad” buttons),  winning the Innovation Award at CES in 2006. He also owns Dragon Books (an LA-based antiquarian bookseller) and one of the founding Formula-E teams (the electric Formula 1 series). </p>



<p>His media business began to flourish with the 2009 acquisition of the Hollywood blog Deadline. The big breakthrough was the $25m acquisition of Variety from Reed Elsevier in 2012,  followed by Fairchild Fashion Media from Condé Nast&nbsp;for some $100m. PMC has continued to expand by acquiring marquee business and “prosumer” magazine brands with international growth potential in information services and events. Two years ago, it took over the operations of MRC Media, including Variety’s principal competitor The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. The deal included a data JV now called Luminate which recently launched Global Hits, tracking the top performing songs across 48 countries, alongside its own Billboard charts. </p>



<p>PMC is also increasingly involved in live events and operates LA3C, a Los Angeles festival of music, art and food; and South by Southwest (SXSW), a festival known for previewing emerging tech businesses.</p>



<p>In a 2022 interview with <em>Flashes &amp; Flames</em>, Penske said his vision for PMC was “as the most culturally relevant and impactful media and events company in the world. We will continue to guide a&nbsp;portfolio (which I expect to continue to diversify), with brands realized at every touchpoint through live experiences, digital experiences, world class content, and one-of-a-kind access in every sense… I see strong continued growth in our international operations and non-English language digital businesses.”</p>
