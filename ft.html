<p>The Nikkei-owned Financial Times is believed to be preparing to spend up to £100m on acquisitions. The UK-based news brand, which generated some £400m revenue in 2021, may be seeking to  grow the proportion of its profits from beyond the FT itself. It is believed that the company’s specialist publications (including The Banker) and its FT Live events generated more than £80m of revenue in 2022 – some 20% of the total and more than 100% of the group profit. </p>



<p>The sense in which the Financial Times is dependant on apparently ancillary operations is underlined also by the FT Weekend leisure edition which is distinct from the main weekday newspaper. It has total subs and copy sales of almost 70,000 – 5x the weekday print edition and at a cover price 45% higher. It may have total revenue of some £40-50m. The FT Weekend’s average revenue probably exceeds that for all five weekdays put together. </p>



<p>Together with the events and specialist publishing, FT Weekend may account for some £130m, 30% of total revenue for 2021 – emphasising just how the company’s growth is increasingly dependant on sources other than the FT’s daily business news in print and digital.</p>



<p>There can, however, be no doubt that these FT activities are able to leverage the brand and its 1.1m digital and print readership. The milestone of 1m digital subs was reached in 2022, some 20 years after the FT had become one of the first major daily newspapers to concertedly push readership revenues to compensate for the loss of advertising, using analytics to understand what its audience wants, who’s reading what, when to charge and when to give content away for free.</p>



<p>In 2007, it introduced an almost-revolutionary paywall. By 2013, it had 300,000 digital subscribers – more than the print total – and digital revenue accounted for 50% of revenues across the FT group. Three years later, the FT reached 850,000 print and digital circulation with digital subs up 14% to 650,000. In 2019, it reached 1m total digital and print subscribers. Then, in 2022, it claimed 1m digital subscribers and 1.1m in total.</p>



<p>Eight years after the FT was acquired by Nikkei from Pearson for £844m (40x operating profit), the UK daily has built its subscriptions through painstakingly managing the data, vertical newsletters, personalised content and networking in print, video, audio, and events. The publisher closely tracks the performance and behaviour of content and readers and its “Quality Reads” identify where readers have read more than half of the article. Editors get weekly reports of how they’re doing. The FT also works hard to get the attention of under-weight readership groups, like women and millennials, by targeting them with print and multimedia content and newsletters.</p>



<p>It is difficult to argue with the FT’s oft-repeated claim that the strategy is “proof that quality journalism can be a quality growth business”. But the disproportionate strength of the events, specialist media brands, and FT Weekend is clear from the overall modest financial performance of the past six years:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><br><strong>£m</strong><br>﻿</td><td><strong>2021</strong></td><td><strong>2020</strong></td><td><strong>2019</strong></td><td><strong>2018</strong></td><td><strong>2017</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue</strong>**</td><td>370</td><td>320</td><td>345</td><td>332</td><td>321</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Op profit</strong> <strong>(loss)</strong></td><td>7.4</td><td>(21)</td><td>0.7</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Margin</strong></td><td>2%</td><td>—</td><td>0.2%</td><td>2%</td><td>1%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>UK statutory accounts for Financial Times Ltd</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>**These financials are for the UK-registered Financial Times Ltd. But the company says they do not include some of the group’s international earnings. In 2021, these additional revenues were said to have totalled some £68m in additional revenue to produce a total of £438m (2020: £370m) reflecting the 45% growth in advertising, which now accounts for 30% of all revenue.</p>



<p>The statutory accounts reveal:</p>



<ul>
<li>Despite the boasts of growing readership in North America, the FT still generates 44% of its revenue in the UK; North America is just 20% with the rest of Europe 24% and Asia/ Middle East only 12%. The proportions have been little changed for almost a decade</li>



<li>The 1,400 headcount (c50% journalists) has increased 8% in the past four years. While there have been increases at new business units, the FT has not seen the need to reduce its core staffing costs</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s why the FT is in the market for acquisitions which will augment its highly-profitable “ancillary” activities.</p>



<p>The investment agenda has, arguably, become more urgent with news that the $10bn-revenue Bloomberg is building up its UK coverage with new recruits, a dedicated website and more consumer-facing content including podcasts and events, all as a first step in an international plan.&nbsp;Bloomberg’s editor in chief John Micklethwait (ex The Economist) has described the strategy as “widening our lens beyond the City (the London banking district) to chart the future of British business in all its forms, telling the story of the new industries and startups that are reshaping post-Brexit Britain, as well as the big beasts of the FTSE100.”</p>



<p>The New York Times – which claims to have seen internal Bloomberg documents – described the move as a bid to compete “directly” with the Financial Times. It’s no accident that the subscription prices of the FT and Bloomberg are similar at £319 and £350 respectively. Unsurprisingly, Bloomberg is aggressively discounting for new UK signups, offering the first three months at 50p a month or a full first year at £149. In comparison, an FT trial is £1 for just four weeks.</p>



<p>Recent Bloomberg recruits have included: a new UK editor, BBC veteran Victoria Wakely,  Emma Barnett, (ex BBC and Daily Telegraph), Alex Wickham (Politico), and Olivia Solon (NBC). Some are sceptical that these mainly non-business journalists represent much of a threat to the FT but the US company’s overpowering competitive advantage is The Terminal which gives customers access to its market data – and generates most of Bloomberg’s revenue.</p>



<p>That, of course, isn’t part of the expanded media offering (even if much of the information is generated by reporters). But it does demonstrate two things Bloomberg brings to its UK battleground: deep pockets and a wealth of data that can be turned into impressive data journalism. There is also an interesting comparison with Bloomberg’s existing, most clearly ‘consumer’ style product, Bloomberg Pursuits. It’s a glossy magazine distributed primarily to those who may already have access to a terminal. It may not be quite as obviously named as the FT’s own “How To Spend It” (now HTSI), the ads-stuffed glossy supplement to FT Weekend. But, if anything, it’s more clearly aimed at some high net-worth people – and the luxury advertising that follows them.&nbsp;It might just start to hit FT Weekend where it hurts.</p>



<p>Bloomberg reportedly aims to attract a potential audience of 7m affluent professional Brits, but the addressable audience may be much smaller. Of the FT’s 1m digital subscribers, more than half of those are outside the UK. Getting them to switch may be difficult but it remains to be seen how Bloomberg may use its existing TV, radio and online media as part of the campaign to broaden its brand in the UK. And just imagine if it was able to acquire (or form some kind of JV with) News Corp’s Wall Street Journal as has been rumoured…</p>



<p>That’s why the Financial Times may now be hungry to invest in diversification, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Events: </strong> FT Live generates revenue from hundreds of in-person and virtual events ranging from blockbuster conferences like the Global Boardroom, Global Commodities, and the Banking Summit, to highly-profitable one-hour webinars on behalf of sponsors (some of which pay £40k for the privilege). Then there’s the FT Weekend Festival in London and Washington DC. In 2022, FT Live’s estimated £30m revenue may have generated £8-9m of profit. Could it be interested in acquiring some or all of the Euromoney events now being de-merged from the Fastnarkets Price Reporting business after the breakup by private equity?</li>



<li><strong>Consulting:</strong> It is two years since the FT launched a dedicated consulting business, FT Strategies, “staffed by the digital transformation experts and consultants” who helped get the FT to 1m subscribers within 10 years. “We transformed the FT from a 130 year old legacy print brand into a thriving digital model. We’ve learnt from our mistakes, and built up practical best-in-class expertise – which we’re sharing with subscriptions businesses like yours to help you thrive in the digital economy.” </li>



<li><strong>Specialist publishing:</strong> The company’s print and digital B2B brands including The Banker, Financial Advisor, Professional Wealth Management, Investors Chronicle, and a range of US-based information services for financial, pensions, and insurance management. They may account for £20m of profit. The rehabiliated £75m Centaur Media (B2B across the marketing-media and legal sectors) might be a suitable acquisition target.</li>



<li><strong>Networks:</strong> FT – which has established member-only communities for company chairs, women and others – might be inspired by the success of World50, Procurement Leaders and others to invest in virtual networks for major industries. </li>



<li><strong>Education:</strong> The FT’s board director training could, similarly, become the starting point to exploit the rapid growth of online executive education.</li>



<li><strong>Forecasting:</strong> The FT might seek to imitate the UK-based global trend forecaster WGSN (now being divested by Ascential, probably for £1bn) and the data-publisher GlobalData. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Financial Times will not be panicking about Bloomberg and nor will its Nikkei owner. But the continuing pressure from Axel Springer’s Business Insider and now Politico, and also the New York Times should add to their concerns, over and above the longterm tussle with the Wall Street Journal. </p>



<p>Nikkei has a long-range view and may be unconcerned about the difficulty in generating consistent profit growth. But – longterm – the FT must reduce its dependance on the UK market – while fighting off the competition. That must mean strengthening its B2B media and events in the UK (and perhaps also the US) while acquiring new B2B verticals.</p>



<p>The reinvention of the New York Times remains the benchmark for traditional news brands everywhere, exemplified by the sheer range of products and services and its powering growth of digital subscriptions (now more than 10m worldwide). It is the (early) frontrunner in the race to become the leading English-speaking, quality news brand. That means growing rivalry for the FT – in the UK and elsewhere – in everything from politics to business. </p>



<p>There’s a lot to admire about the FT. It’s a widely-respected daily news brand in many parts of the world. It is a home of great journalism.</p>



<p>But the three-way assault in the UK from Axel Springer, Bloomberg and the NYT may become serious competition for the FT  – at the same time as it is seeking to become more international. It could be a tough 2023-24.</p>
